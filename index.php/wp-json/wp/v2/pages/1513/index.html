Far from gathering a dusty archive of the cinema\u2019s past, this book uncovers the excitement cinema generated as the art form of modernity. The major theorists &#8212; Kracauer, Bal\u00e1zs, Benjamin, Arnheim and Eisner &#8212; are here as well as filmmakers like Lang, Murnau, Lubitsch, Moholy-Nagy, Ruttmann, Richter, and Reiniger. But perhaps most invaluable, the book assembles views of the cinema by the intellectuals, journalists, cameramen, poets, film stars, novelists, architects and composers who made German modernity perhaps the most complex and fascinating of all the modern movements. Reading through these witnesses to cinema when it was a new medium may teach us much about the promises offered by our current period of transition and transformation. Film studies may take years to digest the richness this volume contains &#8212; and I believe it will never be quite the same afterwards.&#8221;<\/p>\r\n<h4><strong>\u2014Tom Gunning, University of Chicago<\/strong><\/h4>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cOpening entirely new pathways to the research and teaching of German film culture, this carefully edited sourcebook reveals the fantastic wealth of early ideas and thoughts on cinema.\u201d<\/p>\r\n<h4><strong>\u2014Gertrud Koch, Freie Universit\u00e4t, Berlin<\/strong><\/h4>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>&#8220;Page after page, a vibrant debate, previously lost in archives, comes to life again. An impressive portrait, depicted with strokes of love, hate, hope, disillusion, unfolds before our eyes.
