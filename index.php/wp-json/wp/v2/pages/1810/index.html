The note has its place in the context of methodological formulations concerning the temporality of historical interpretation and what is conceived of, in this serendipitous study of nineteenth-century Paris, as historical dream and historical awakening. One awakens from \u201cthat dream we name the past\u201d only by descending back through remembrance into the convolute of the dream itself; one wakes simultaneously <em>from <\/em>and <em>to<\/em> a dream past in order to waken a present day. So historical awakening is prepared in dreaming of the past. It is nothing short of a \u201cCopernican revolution in historical perception\u201d that Benjamin announces here, in Convolute K of the <em>Arcades<\/em>: a momentous theoretical turn toward a dialectical method of historical remembrance pivoting on \u201cthe higher concreteness of now-being.\u201d<a href=\"#_edn1\" name=\"_ednref1\">[1]<\/a> Such perception is dialectical because it is turned toward past and present at the same time; it is their virtual convergence as monad and mutual tension in an experience of recognition. In this precipitous constellatory temporality, in which time at once shrinks and expands, the moment of remembrance is thus \u201cpreformed\u201d in its object.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'helvetica', serif; font-weight: normal;\">Benjamin distinguishes this encapsulated historical force field of now-being, this oscillating now of recognizability, from what we like to call the present in the construction of chronological time, \u201csince [now-being] is a being punctuated and intermittent.\u201d You begin to see here the connection to film form in this species of montage thinking, this dialectical theory of historical understanding, or, to put it a little differently, this monadological conception of truth. Benjamin goes on to expound the so-to-speak chemical interaction of present and past in his historical-materialist philosophy of time\u2014the present as a critical and creative distillation of the past\u2014in words that bear on the stated intention of <em>The Promise of Cinema<\/em>, namely, to reconstruct a specific set of historical debates on the subject of film:<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'helvetica', serif; font-weight: normal;\">And this dialectical penetration and actualization of former contexts puts the truth of the present action to the test. Or rather, it serves to ignite the explosive materials that are latent in what has been\u2026. To approach, in this way, what has been [<em>So an das Gewesene herangehen<\/em>] means to treat it not historiographically, as heretofore, but politically, in political categories.

The political-educational function of cinema is exemplified first and foremost in the cultivation of that disciplined and dynamic multilateral attentiveness he designates, with a nod to Dada, \u201creception in distraction,\u201d a productively dispersed form of perception, a coordinated distraction (<em>Zerstreuung<\/em>), such as emerges in the process of learning to read motion pictures, to negotiate the nonstop metamorphosis of image and discern its sequencing. This continuous interruption of view\u2014technical precedents for which <em>The Arcades Project<\/em> traces in nineteenth-century modes of exhibition and spectatorship\u2014constitutes the shock effect of film, which, \u201clike all shock effects, seeks to induce heightened attention\u201d (Baudelairean principle). For the ability to receive and decisively process impressions while being drawn in different directions\u2014multitasking as a canon of perception\u2014has become a condition of modern metropolitan life and its proliferating traffic; moreover, this sort of multilevel assimilation of fast-changing environments, often involving the navigation of ambiguities, is said to be \u201cincreasingly noticeable in all areas of art.\u201d<a href=\"#_edn3\" name=\"_ednref3\">[3]<\/a><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'helvetica', serif; font-weight: normal;\">Especially striking in the <em>Arcades<\/em> note, where the aesthetics of film is taken as epitomizing the diverse problems, and hence tasks, of contemporary art,<a href=\"#_edn4\" name=\"_ednref4\">[4]<\/a> is the emphasis on the operative rhythms to be unfolded in today\u2019s <em>machines<\/em>. Already in the late Twenties this would have presupposed the experiments in \u201cabsolute film\u201d by L\u00e9ger, Richter, Ruttmann, Eggeling, et al. (compare, in particular, Ruttmann\u2019s comments on tempo, velocity, and rhythm in <em>Promise of Cinema<\/em>, 451). But it would be a mistake to think that Benjamin, the admirer of Adolphe Menjou and Katharine Hepburn,<a href=\"#_edn5\" name=\"_ednref5\">[5]<\/a> is indirectly advocating the production of \u201cabstract\u201d or cubist cinema, with its \u201cnon-representational\u201d musical and choreographic geometries, or that he is seeking in some way to subvert mimetic or naturalistic conventions.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/2FceQL9_dUY\" width=\"391\" height=\"314\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><small><i>Stage Door<\/i> (Gregory La Cava, 1937) with Katherine Hepburn and Adolphe Menjou<\/small><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'helvetica', serif; font-weight: normal;\">In fact, Benjamin\u2019s attitude toward the cinematic avant-garde in that period was very close to Kracauer\u2019s (see the latter\u2019s \u201cAbstract Film\u201d of 1928 in <em>Promise of Cinema<\/em>, 465-467). In Convolute K of the<em> Arcades Project<\/em>, having warned of the sometimes subtle dangers of sentimentality, the calculated \u201ccomfort of the heart\u201d that qualifies art for consumption, he writes that anyone recognizing the capacity of popular film to<em> transform<\/em> the mass-consumerist tendencies of \u201cthat strange and perhaps formerly unknown material which is kitsch\u201d into educational-political tendencies will be \u201cinclined to disallow the pretensions of abstract film, as important as its experiments may be\u201d (K3a,1).

The latter would have to be understood in a broad sense that comprehends both Chaplin and Mickey Mouse, both the documentary and the oneiric tendencies of film.

With the close-up, space expands; with slow motion, movement is extended\u2026. Clearly, it is another nature which speaks to the camera as compared to the eye. \u201cOther\u201d above all in the sense that a space informed by human consciousness gives way to a space informed by the unconscious [<em>ein unbewu<\/em><em>\u03b2<\/em><em>t durchwirkter [Raum]<\/em>\u2014that is, the sort of space that a body \u201cworks through\u201d reflexively, without conscious thought].<a href=\"#_edn12\" name=\"_ednref12\">[12]<\/a><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'helvetica', serif; font-weight: normal;\">In the reply to Schmitz, which lays stress, more generally, on the vaunted emergence of \u201ca new realm of consciousness\u201d with the advent of film, Benjamin frames this project of shattering the prison house of routine commodified existence with a notion omitted (presumably, so as to avoid mixing metaphors) in all versions of the \u201cWork of Art\u201d essay, namely, the notion of the distinctively \u201cprismatic work\u201d of cinema: \u201cTo put it in a nutshell, film is the prism in which the spaces of the immediate environment\u2014the spaces in which people live, pursue their vocations, and enjoy their leisure\u2014are laid open before their eyes in a\u2026meaningful and passionate way.\u201d There follows an earlier and less trenchant version of the passage on calm adventures taken among widely scattered remnants of the opened-up\u2014blasted\/refracted\u2014prison world, and then he adds: \u201cThe vicinity of a house, of a room, can include dozens of the most unexpected stations.\u201d<a href=\"#_edn13\" name=\"_ednref13\">[13]<\/a><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'helvetica', serif; font-weight: normal;\">There are striking anticipations of this conception in Bal\u00e1zs\u2019s chapter on \u201cThe Close-Up\u201d in his <em>Visible Man<\/em> of 1924 (which evokes the camera\u2019s unconcealment of the secret life of things in \u201cthose hidden little corners\u201d of daily existence), as well as in Hofmannsthal\u2019s 1921 piece, \u201cThe Substitute for Dreams,\u201d and Kracauer\u2019s 1924 review, \u201cA Film\u201d (<em>Promise of Cinema<\/em>, nos. 176, 178, and 222; see also 252). The explosive prismatic illumination of inconspicuous stations within the confines of an ordinary milieu (and, it must be added, in the topography of a face) is primarily, Benjamin argues, a function of sudden change of location or perspective,<a href=\"#_edn14\" name=\"_ednref14\">[14]<\/a> as effected by camera movement, adjustments in focus and lighting, and editing processes, that is, by film rhythm. Just think of the sequences in <em>M<\/em> where Peter Lorre is hiding in a warehouse, and of the way this dull and ordinary collective space, as the police enter the scene, suddenly becomes a <em>Spielraum<\/em> full of unexpected situations.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/u3rWLm_PAbc?rel=0&amp;start=4800&amp;end=4900&amp;autoplay=0\" width=\"391\" height=\"314\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'helvetica', serif; font-weight: normal;\">Here is a kind of film poetry, to use Lubitsch\u2019s happy term (<em>Promise of Cinema<\/em>, 209), arising purely out of the resources of cinematic naturalism. And\u2014this is all-important to Benjamin\u2014it is filmic poetry capable of an educative political impact, one that, in its immediacy and widespread appeal (compare no. 164 [Bal\u00e1zs] and no. 229 [Karl Freund] in <em>Promise of Cinema<\/em> concerning \u201cpopularity\u201d), would exceed anything to be found in the contemporary theater. (I leave open the question whether such prismatic poetry might work to <em>restore<\/em> a non-meretricious and, as it were, profane aura to film.)<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'helvetica', serif; font-weight: normal;\">For Benjamin, the collective subject of these milieux films was the variegated class of workers, and the political value of the film medium lay in large part in its redemption of the \u201chumanity\u201d thought to be everywhere relinquished in \u201coffices and factories.\u201d Too well-known to need quoting are the passages in the Artwork essay (sections X-XII of the 1936 version) on the film actor\u2019s ultimate victory over the apparatus by means of the resources of the apparatus itself, that is, the actor\u2019s piecemeal exploitation of his or her own self-alienation before the camera and recording equipment for the purpose of producing an \u201cequipment-free\u201d image of human experience as such. At issue in the paradoxical production of this critical promise of cinema is what Benjamin calls a test performance (<em>Testleistung<\/em>), a formulation I would like to set beside the passage from the <em>Arcades<\/em> (K2,3) I quoted at the outset, the passage concerned with the historical materialist testing (<em>Probe<\/em>) of the researcher\u2019s own present day. If technology characteristically poses a test of some kind for the human subject, then the film director and crew, through their technological penetration and artistic \u201covercoming\u201d of collective milieux, and through the \u201cmeaningful and passionate\u201d illumination of human situations that results from this process, can be said to put the truth of the technological test itself, whether implicitly or explicitly, to the test.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'helvetica', serif; font-weight: normal;\">So it is both formal integrity or texture and human actuality or \u201cphysiognomy\u201d (Bal\u00e1zs\u2019s term as well<a href=\"#_edn15\" name=\"_ednref15\">[15]<\/a>) that Benjamin describes and calls for in the art of film. The bombardment of Odessa in <em>Battleship Potemkin<\/em> and the pogrom against factory workers in <em>Mother<\/em> are cited, in the reply to Schmitz, as exemplary sequences: both convey the suffering of the urban masses as though engraved in \u201crunning script\u201d (a formula recalling Bal\u00e1zs\u2019s point, made a year earlier, about the \u201callegorical power\u201d of Eisenstein\u2019s imagery [<em>Promise of Cinema<\/em>, 507]).<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Oxg83VuS7cw\" width=\"391\" height=\"314\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'helvetica', serif; font-weight: normal;\">Such fluid \u201cinscription\u201d would have everything to do with cinematic rhythm understood as the sublimation of geometry and pathos. We can think of rhythm in general as involving its own dialectic of before and after, insofar as a rhythmic trajectory, like the trajectory of a melody or of a fairy tale, is not simply linear and developmental but also recursive and anticipatory, embodying at virtually every point in different ways both a recollection of its beginning and a prefiguration of its end, and thus articulating\u2014it may be, in the form of disaggregation\u2014a spatiotemporal plasticity.<a href=\"#_edn16\" name=\"_ednref16\">[16]<\/a><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'helvetica', serif; font-weight: normal;\">In <em>The Arcades Project<\/em> Benjamin refers to the world of fl\u00e2nerie, that is, the practice of urban strolling that\u2014like the practice of collecting\u2014functions as a model for the project as a whole, in terms of just such a spatiotemporal dynamic: an \u201cinterpenetrating and superposed transparency\u201d (S2,1). And we are invited to consider this stratified and elastic<a href=\"#_edn17\" name=\"_ednref17\">[17]<\/a> trans-parence, this strangely encompassing <em>Durchdringungs- und \u00dcberdeckungstransparenz<\/em>, as a medium of presentation and experience: in short, an elaborately interwoven<em> textual<\/em> world. Here is the point of departure for a shock-heightened prismatic attentiveness. Drawn as he is by the virtually tactile resonance of the past in discrete objects of the urban environment (in the name of a restaurant, in a particular shop front or stretch of paving stones), the fl\u00e2neur, with untoward \u201cfelt knowledge\u201d (M1,5), senses the city\u2019s history everywhere superimposed on its present day in a kind of fluid, \u201crunning\u201d palimpsest, a sustained and even kaleidoscopic dissolve. It is through this interpenetrating rhythm of reading as a form of anticipatory remembrance, what Benjamin, the translator of Proust,<a href=\"#_edn18\" name=\"_ednref18\">[18]<\/a> regards as \u201cdimensional seeing\u201d or layered now-being, that the commonplace aspect of the commonplace is penetrated and dispelled.
