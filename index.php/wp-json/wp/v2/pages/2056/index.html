Yet, especially in Germany, gymnastics and modern dance formed an important context that clearly resonated in the debates surrounding the new medium.<a href=\"#_edn1\" name=\"_ednref1\"><sup>[1]<\/sup><\/a> Not only were the same people\u2014intellectuals, artists and critics\u2014commenting on contemporary events in film and dance, but early film theory and modern dance were also surrounded by similar concerns and inquiries: When is a movement \u201cbeautiful\u201d? What makes a body expressive? And which specific forms of a viewer\u2019s aesthetic experience are addressed through movement?<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'helvetica', serif; font-weight: normal;\">Early film theoretical considerations had posed these questions with regard to concepts such as \u201cexpressive movement\u201d and \u201cmovement arts\u201d since the beginning of the 1910s. Authors like Herbert Tannenbaum and B\u00e9la Bal\u00e1zs referred quite explicitly to the dance and body culture of the time\u2014for example, when it was appropriate to use dance as a model for silent but strongly expressive film acting.<a href=\"#_edn2\" name=\"_ednref2\"><sup>[2]<\/sup><\/a> By contrast, beginning in the 1920s, avant-garde theory appealed to the structural analogy of film as a \u201cdance of images.\u201d Filmmakers as distinct as Walter Ruttmann and Oskar Fischinger, or Dziga Vertov and Germaine Dulac, composed a counter-cinema based on the model of dance and music, which sought to communicate not with story and words, but first and foremost with the interplay of sensual qualities like movement, light and color.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><center>\r\n<div style=\"width: 400px;\" class=\"wp-video\"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');<\/script><![endif]-->\n<video class=\"wp-video-shortcode\" id=\"video-2056-1\" width=\"400\" height=\"290\" preload=\"metadata\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"video\/mp4\" src=\"http:\/\/www.thepromiseofcinema.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/Studienr8.mp4?_=1\" \/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.thepromiseofcinema.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/Studienr8.mp4\">http:\/\/www.thepromiseofcinema.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/Studienr8.mp4<\/a><\/video><\/div>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><small>Excerpt from <em>Studie Nr. 8<\/em> (D 1932, Oskar Fischinger)<\/small><\/p>\r\n<\/center><\/div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'helvetica', serif; font-weight: normal;\">By the same token, dancers, choreographers and dance theorists were among the artists and intellectuals who engaged with cinema at the beginning of the twentieth century. Their reactions to the new medium were deeply ambivalent\u2014while modern dancers like Isadora Duncan and Mary Wigman spoke out decidedly against filmic recording of their dances, they were simultaneously fascinated by cinema as a popular entertainment medium. For instance, both Duncan and Wigman are said to have been passionate fans of cinema, eagerly going out to see the latest films and serials. Dancers\u2019 commentaries\u2014sometimes polemics against cinema, sometimes euphoric proposals for a transmedial movement art\u2014open up a unique space for reflection on film.\u00a0These comments show not only how closely dance and film cultures were intertwined, but also how they\u00a0can be unterstood as early theories of body and movement in the cinema.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'helvetica', serif; font-weight: normal;\">Among the dancers and dance theorists who were thinking about cinema at the turn of the twentieth century is the choreographer and dance theorist Rudolf Laban (1879-1958, born Rezs\u0151 Laban de V\u00e0raljas). As one of the leading figures of expressive dance, he joined the conversation in the late 1920s. He had spent the years between 1913 and 1919 researching \u201cthe natural motion of the human being\u201d [\u201cdie nat\u00fcrliche Bewegtheit des Menschens\u201d] in the artistic colony and life reform center on the Monte Verit\u00e0.<a href=\"#_edn3\" name=\"_ednref3\"><sup>[3]<\/sup><\/a> After 1920, Laban shifted increasingly into theater and education: as a choreographer and artistic director at various German theaters and opera houses, he quickly came to oversee a comprehensive network of dance schools and held important positions in cultural policy. Laban\u2019s contribution to the film theoretical debates in Germany in the 1910s and 1920s have received little attention to date, perhaps due to the difficulty of accessing sources. Most of Laban\u2019s film projects are <em>not<\/em> available to us today (some were never made, others did not survive or have not been rediscovered yet). But the anthology <em>The Promise of Cinema<\/em> presents a document that allows us to look more closely at Laban\u2019s thoughts on cinema\u2014including their internal tensions and contradictions. Under the headline \u201cFilm and dance belong together,\u201d <em>Der Film-Kurier<\/em> published a conversation between Rudolf von Laban and film critic Lotte Eisner.<a href=\"#_edn4\" name=\"_ednref4\"><sup>[4]<\/sup><\/a> This document\u00a0from 1928 is remarkable for several reasons: it shows not only that dancers and choreographers like Laban were actively involved in the public debate on film, but also that concrete concepts of film as a \u201cmovement art\u201d were being developed.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'helvetica', serif; font-weight: normal;\">The article appeared in the summer of 1928, when public interest in expressive dance had reached its peak, in the context of the second German Dance Congress. A year earlier, dancers, choreographers, and dance critics had convened in Magdeburg for the first Dance Congress. The goal of the congress was to organize dance socially, politically and artistically, and to raise awareness among the broader public of the issues faced by dance and dance professionals.<a href=\"#_edn5\" name=\"_ednref5\"><sup>[5]<\/sup><\/a> Laban, who had participated in the organization of the Dance Congress, presented himself to the film critic Lotte Eisner as the spokesman of the modern dance movement. If Laban demonstrated a readiness to engage with the filmic medium, I argue that his primary aim was to emphasize the modernity of dance, and to situate dance as the key discipline for a modern world in movement. What is remarkable about Laban\u2019s film theory is that is was not oriented towards the concept of a self-identical medium; he was much more interested in film as a heterogeneity of media practices, which allowed for diverse access points to the project of modern dance. This simultaneously allowed him a strategic opportunity to introduce his dance and film projects to the readers of the <em>Film-Kurier<\/em>.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">=\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.cabinetmagazine.org\/issues\/36\/L-F-1-38-300004_FINAL.jpg?resize=328%2C438g\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-313\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.cabinetmagazine.org\/issues\/36\/L-F-1-38-300004_FINAL.jpg?resize=328%2C438\" alt=\"\" width=\"328\" height=\"438\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><small>In 1928, Rudolf von Laban presents his dance notation, \u201ckinetography\u201d.<\/small><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'helvetica', serif; font-weight: normal;\"><strong><em>I. Writing Dance. Film as a Tool for the Choreographer<\/em><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'helvetica', serif; font-weight: normal;\">The first matter that Laban highlights in his conversation with Eisner is the case for his dance notation system, on which he had been working since the 1910s and which he first introduced to a wider public at the Dance Congress in Essen. The name \u201ckinetography\u201d and the fact that he uses filmic terms like \u201croll\u201d [<em>Rolle<\/em>] and \u201crunning strip\u201d [<em>laufendes Band<\/em>] in his descriptions indicate the extent to which his conception\u2014whether consciously or not\u2014had been influenced by the model of film. Unlike previously existing notation systems, which remained limited to a specific dance vocabulary, this movement script\u2014like film\u2014was intended to suit <em>any<\/em> form of movement. Formally, Laban\u2019s system was based on the five-line system of musical notation. These lines showed not only the rhythm and duration of a movement, but simultaneously marked spatial coordinates and signified a dancer\u2019s individual body parts.<a href=\"#_edn6\" name=\"_ednref6\"><sup>[6]<\/sup><\/a> Furthermore, qualities of movement such as direction, impetus and force were also notated.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2060 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.thepromiseofcinema.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/lk.png?resize=916%2C325\" width=\"916\" height=\"325\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.thepromiseofcinema.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/lk.png?w=916 916w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.thepromiseofcinema.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/lk.png?resize=300%2C106 300w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.thepromiseofcinema.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/lk.png?resize=768%2C272 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 916px) 100vw, 916px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><small>Laban\u2019s \u201ckinetography\u201d is based on the five-line system of musical notation.<\/small><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'helvetica', serif; font-weight: normal;\">A crucial element was that Laban saw his \u201ckinetography\u201d not only as a tool for <em>ex post facto<\/em> illustration of choreography, but also as a creative and choreographic instrument, which would allow new dances to be fabricated in a written medium: \u201cThe goal is written dance, and by means of this written form of inscribed and thoroughly composed dance, the spiritualization\u2014and with it, liberation\u2014of the body: the wish and will of our time.\u201d<a href=\"#_edn7\" name=\"_ednref7\"><sup>[7]<\/sup><\/a> With this function, namely as an instrument of planning and coordination, Laban also recommends his movement notation for use in film production. It would allow the director to \u201cwrite down\u201d a scene\u2019s blocking before filming and to deliver it to actors \u201cto study ahead of time.\u201d The practice that Laban thus conceived is obviously connected to screenplay practices, but replaces dialogue with movement notation. The author Werner Schuftan made a similar argument in 1929. With Laban\u2019s movement script, he wrote, a screenwriter could \u201cclearly and unambiguously record in written form things that can only be expressed through motion, but never through words.\u201d<a href=\"#_edn8\" name=\"_ednref8\"><sup>[8]<\/sup><\/a> Schuftan\u2019s critique of the orally composed screenplay can be compared with voices that, starting in 1910, spoke out against the literarization of film and were therefore vehemently opposed to literary models and screenplays.<a href=\"#_edn9\" name=\"_ednref9\"><sup>[9]<\/sup><\/a> An interesting element of Laban\u2019s and Schuftan\u2019s position, however, is that they do not reject the screenplay, but rather take up <em>script<\/em> (movement notation) as a choreographic medium and present this as a counterexample to word culture. However, their suggestion resonated poorly in the world of film production; this may have been due, among other causes, to the large amount of time required to learn the notation system, which undermined Laban\u2019s argument regarding \u201cwork simplification.\u201d It is also questionable how much demand existed in the film sector for an instrument of movement planning.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2061 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.thepromiseofcinema.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/lms.png?resize=974%2C635\" width=\"974\" height=\"635\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.thepromiseofcinema.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/lms.png?w=974 974w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.thepromiseofcinema.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/lms.png?resize=300%2C196 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.thepromiseofcinema.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/lms.png?resize=768%2C501 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 974px) 100vw, 974px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><small>With Laban\u2019s movement script, gestures and blocking for film scenes could be planned in advance, advises Werner Schuftan in 1929.<\/small><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'helvetica', serif; font-weight: normal;\"><strong><em>II.

This is significant because the use of film was quite controversial among dancers and choreographers of expressionistic dance. Depending on context, Laban positioned himself sometimes as a supporter of the medium (as in the <em>Film-Kurier<\/em>), at other times as a vehement critic.<a href=\"#_edn10\" name=\"_ednref10\"><sup>[10]<\/sup><\/a> It was especially the Kulturfilm <em>Wege zu Kraft und Sch\u00f6nheit<\/em> [Ways to Strength and Beauty] (Germany 1925, Wilhelm Prager and Nicholas Kaufmann), which formed the important intermediary between dancers and the film sector. It portrayed the dance and body culture movement and brought numerous dancers (Niddy Impekoven, Mary Wigman) and contemporary dance schools before the camera. Scenes from the film show Laban with students of the Laban School of Hamburg in the dance drama <em>Das Idol<\/em>:<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/ZTpuPbLf68s?rel=0&amp;start=6&amp;autoplay=0\" width=\"400\" height=\"290\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'helvetica', serif; font-weight: normal;\">For many other dancers, these recordings were their first encounters with film production. For Laban, too, participation in <em>Wege zu Kraft und Sch\u00f6nheit<\/em> marked a decisive milestone. If, up to that point, he had retained a certain distance with regard to film as a \u00abmachine\u00bb that could record movement, by the end of the 1920s he became increasingly aware of cinema\u2019s potential in the propagation of modern dance. By the end of the 1920s, film recordings of Laban and his students could be seen not only in Kulturfilms, but also in weekly newsreels\u2014for example, the recordings of\u00a0<em>Tanz und Bewegungs\u00fcbungen der Schule Rudolf v. Laban <\/em>[<em>Dance and Movement Exercises of the Rudolf v. Laban School<\/em>], which was shown in 1928 as part of the Deulig-Weekly.<a href=\"#_edn11\" name=\"_ednref11\"><sup>[11]<\/sup><\/a> The film shows Laban\u2019s students, who present the principles of his\u00a0space and movement lessons with the aid of a life-size model of an icosahedron [a geometrical form] and perform a choral group dance (recorded in the garden of Laban\u2019s school in Berlin-Grunewald). More than a documentary record of the dances, these recordings were\u00a0choreographed specifically for the camera: the dancers\u2019 glance penetratingly into the lens, which translates their backwards-seesawing movements into the depths of the space into (spatial, bodily and expressive) tension for the film spectator as well.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><center>\r\n<div style=\"width: 400px;\" class=\"wp-video\"><video class=\"wp-video-shortcode\" id=\"video-2056-2\" width=\"400\" height=\"290\" preload=\"metadata\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"video\/mp4\" src=\"http:\/\/www.thepromiseofcinema.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/monte-v-clip.mp4?_=2\" \/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.thepromiseofcinema.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/monte-v-clip.mp4\">http:\/\/www.thepromiseofcinema.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/monte-v-clip.mp4<\/a><\/video><\/div>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><small>Excerpt from <em>Monte Verit\u00e0<\/em> (FR 1997, Henry Colomer)<\/small><\/p>\r\n<\/center><\/div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><em><span style=\"font-family: 'helvetica', serif; font-weight: normal;\"><strong>III.

By referencing <em>Der Drachent\u00f6ter<\/em> [The Dragon Slayer], Laban demonstrates\u00a0that he had already taken up the possibilities of sound film as early as 1928. This was a \u201cfilm-dance-pantomime,\u201d which was recorded, under the direction of Laban and Prager, as \u201caudible film\u201d [\u201cH\u00f6rfilm\u201d] in 1927 or 1928 with a process developed by the company Bolten-Baeckers.<a href=\"#_edn12\" name=\"_ednref12\"><sup>[12]<\/sup><\/a> The film was based on the choreography <em>Drachent\u00f6terei<\/em> [Dragonslaying] by Dussia Bereska, which had premiered in 1923; dancing the main part, Laban appeared alongside the dancers in his troupe (the Laban Chamber Dancers [<em>Kammertanzb\u00fchne Laban<\/em>]). <em>Der Drachent\u00f6ter<\/em> premiered in September 1928 at the technology exhibit of the Dresden Annual Expo\u2014accordingly, it was considered first and foremost as a technical experiment with the new sound film process, and a refined \u201ccombination of technology and art.\u201d<a href=\"#_edn13\" name=\"_ednref13\"><sup>[13]<\/sup><\/a> Laban himself also highlights\u00a0the technical dimension, seeing in this film \u201cproof that dance accompanied by music can be effectively adapted for sound film.\u201d<a href=\"#_edn14\" name=\"_ednref14\"><sup>[14]<\/sup><\/a><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2062 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/www.thepromiseofcinema.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/d.png?resize=916%2C325\" width=\"916\" height=\"325\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/www.thepromiseofcinema.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/d.png?w=916 916w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/www.thepromiseofcinema.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/d.png?resize=300%2C106 300w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/www.thepromiseofcinema.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/d.png?resize=768%2C272 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 916px) 100vw, 916px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><small>Stills from <em>Der Drachent\u00f6ter<\/em>\u00a0(Germany 1929), which Rudolf von Laban and Wilhelm Prager made first as a silent, and then as a sound film.<\/small><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'helvetica', serif; font-weight: normal;\">After the success of <em>Wege zur Kraft und Sch\u00f6nheit\u00a0<\/em>[<em>Ways to Strength and Beauty<\/em>], Laban and the film director Wilhelm Prager began to compose a series of screenplays, among them the scenario for a \u201cdance film\u201d that would be \u201cthe greatest work of film-dance,\u201d as Laban claimed in his conversation with Lotte Eisner. Indeed, sketches and scenarios for several dance films are to be found in the portion of his estate housed in the Leipzig Dance Archive.<a href=\"#_edn15\" name=\"_ednref15\"><sup>[15]<\/sup><\/a> With the project <em>Das lebende Bild<\/em> [The Living Image], for example, Laban intended to repurpose his notation system for a broader public. We can assume that this project\u2014like many other film scripts that Laban completed toward the end of the 1920s\u2014was never made. That said, Laban lacked neither conviction that film was an appropriate medium for the distribution of his dance and movement doctrine, nor the capacity to imagine how this might be concretely translated into film. From detailed illustrations in his film manuscripts, we can conclude that Laban had imagined a\u00a0film language, which was intended as a sensory-perceptive overture to the viewer. By means of moving forms, surfaces and lines,\u00a0recordings of \u201cFootsteps in the Snow\u201d in <em>Das lebende Bild<\/em> would gradually dissolve into animated forms of the notation system. Using double-exposure and other animation techniques, the notation symbols would be dramatized in such a way that the audience could understand the connection between writing and movement not only intellectually, but also through the dance itself. All the methods of composition that had been put to painstaking use in the screenplays and storyboards [<em>Filmskizzen<\/em>] aimed to foreground movement, in its associations, rhythmic correspondences and particular laws.\u00a0Laban\u2019s efforts to use the medium of film to address new forms of sensory-bodily experience bear a clear structural resemblance to the perceptual experiments that were contemporaneously undertaken by such filmmakers as Walter Ruttmann, Dziga Vertov, or Jean Epstein.<a href=\"#_edn16\" name=\"_ednref16\"><sup>[16]<\/sup><\/a>\u00a0At the same time, Laban&#8217;s film projects, with their romantic imagery (mostly scenes of an idyllic nature untouched by civilization) stood in sharp contrast to avantgardistic concepts of the mechanized modernity.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2063 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.thepromiseofcinema.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/tli.png?resize=974%2C348\" width=\"974\" height=\"348\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.thepromiseofcinema.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/tli.png?w=974 974w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.thepromiseofcinema.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/tli.png?resize=300%2C107 300w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.thepromiseofcinema.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/tli.png?resize=768%2C274 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 974px) 100vw, 974px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><small>Detail from Laban\u2019s screenplay for the dance film The Living Image (ca. 1928).

Against a \u201cliterarization\u201d of cinema, authors like Heinz Ewers, Hermann H\u00e4fker and, somewhat later, B\u00e9la Bal\u00e1zs claimed that cinema should take reference from the tools proper to it (camera, motion, etc.) (cf.
