	This website serves as an archive and forum for research on Weimar cinema, 
	often considered one of the most innovative and influential
	periods in the history of film. While building on the sourcebook <a href="./index.php/the-book/index.html" target="_blank"><em>The
	Promise of Cinema: German Film Theory, 1907–1933</em></a>, this site offers several
	new features, including online access to early German <a href="./index.php/streaming-films/index.html" target="_blank">films</a> as well
	as digitized <a href="./index.php/further-texts-in-german/index.html" target="_blank">books</a> and <a href="./index.php/digitized-historical-journals/index.html" target="_blank">journals</a> from period. We also draw links between
	<a href="./index.php/films/index.html">selected films</a> and texts from the book, and list new <a href="./index.php/new-publications/index.html" target="_blank">publications</a>
	and <a href="./index.php/new-restorations/index.html" target="_blank">restorations</a>. In a section called <a href="./index.php/explorations/index.html" target="_blank">Explorations</a>, we experiment with
	materials for a conceptual approach to film history – finding dynamic
	constellations between past and present, local and global, film and theory. 
	The website also features original <a href="./index.php/essays/index.html" target="_blank">essays</a> by scholars who reflect on the
	promise of cinema against the backdrop of contemporary work in media
	archaeology.  We are planning to add new chapters about Weimar cinema’s
	relation to colonialism, sexuality, environment, and democracy. For
	suggestions and proposed contributions, please contact us <a href="./index.php/contact-2/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
